# labday2017-LSTM
Using LSTMs and adapting their architectures for time-series analysis

## Purpose
Purpose of this repo is to kickoff an LSTM exploration project for KPN Data Science Labday 2017

## Goals

* Follow [this](https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-prediction-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/) tutorial to get a first analysis up and running
* Try the same code on a different data set
* Improve performance on that dataset by experimenting with parameters

## Prerequisites

* Have a keras / tensorflow environment available to start in a virtual environment
  * [Guide for inspiration](https://gist.github.com/pumpikano/24b55447ef8b2d8f5c4d)
